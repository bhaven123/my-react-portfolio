          <p>
            As a Full Stack Engineer and Machine Learning enthusiast, I bring a
            unique blend of skills and experience to any project. With expertise
            in front-end and back-end technologies such as ReactJS, NodeJS,
            ExpressJS, MongoDB, and databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL, I am
            capable of designing and building scalable, responsive, and visually
            appealing applications. Additionally, my proficiency in machine
            learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn,
            coupled with a Master's in Applied Computer Science, enables me to
            develop intelligent systems that can analyze data, make predictions,
            and automate processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether it's building a robust web application or developing a
            machine learning model, I am passionate about learning and
            delivering high-quality work that meets business requirements. If
            you're looking for a Full Stack Engineer with expertise in Machine
            Learning, feel free to connect with me.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am very excited to kickstart my professional career. I am a self
            starter and a quick learner. Additionally, I am open to learning new
            things. Currently, I am working on building a Task Management App
            using ReactJS and on a cake-ordering application with frontend in
            ReactJS and backend using NodeJS and ExpressJS with database
            connection to MongoDB.
